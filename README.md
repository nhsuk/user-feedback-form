# User Feedback Form

A javascript plugin to add a user feedback form to your website.

You will also need a backend data store. See [user-feedback-store](https://github.com/nhsuk/user-feedback-store).

## Quickstart

### npm

Install from npm (TODO: release package to npm)
```bash
npm install ___
```

Use script in your javascript build

```js
import userFeedbackForm from '___';

userFeedbackForm({
    cssSelector: "#my-div-id",
    formEndpoint: "https://example.com/my-api-endpoint/",
});
```

### script

If you do not have a node-based javascript frontend build, you can use the minified javascript distribution.

```html
<!-- in the html <head> -->
<script src="./user-feedback-form.min.js" defer></script>

<div id="nhsuk-user-feedback-form" data-form-endpoint="https://example.com/endpoint/"></div>
